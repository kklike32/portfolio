            <h5>During my time in the engineering program, I have met a number 
                of industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest 
                speakers which has broadened my perspective on Engineering.  The 
                field trips helped my identify possible workplaces/colleges that I
                can attend in the future. The workplaces showed me the many careers
                that are available within Engineering, including QA analyst, 
                environmental engineer, marine engineer, e.t.c. Guest speakers 
                helped me realize what  people do on a daily basis when 
                working in the field.</h5>
            
            
        
            
            <h4 class="text-center">Mentorship Program</h4>
            <h5>My mentor was Sidhar Kuppuswamy. Through him, I learned important lessons related 
                to workplace and career life. Firstly, the college you attend is not at all important,
                rather the internships and connections you make through the college is the most 
                important. Your major may not always be your future, so it is important to have an 
                open and flexible mind. The people in your workplace are very important, they can 
                introduce you to new career opportunities, new people, and help you enjoy work. </h5>

                        <p> In 10th grade, I went on a campus tour to both San Jose State and Santa Clara University. 
                            Since I am a high schooler, I was interested in learning about university life and how to 
                            get accepted. The trip provided me with more than just the answers; the tour showed me how 
                            to apply for various majors like Computer Science major which I can apply for. Santa Clara 
                            University also showed me how I can learn biotech, one of the fastest-growing industries, 
                            while still taking regular computer science classes. Overall, the trip helped me gain more 
                            experience on how university students use their classes and school opportunities to help them 
                            get a job in the engineering field.</p>

                        <p> In 10th grade, my class and I visited the biotechnology company 
                            Roche Molecular Systems. It was an amazing introduction as to what
                            biotechnology exactly is. I got to see niche machines that do 
                            complicated tests and complex tasks to help scientists find information. 
                            It helped me realize how important biotecnology as it grows in the future,
                            as it can combat diseases, viruses, and other biological problems.
                            Through Roche, I not only met scientists, but I had a chance to 
                            talk to sales people, engineers, directors, and more. Overall, it 
                            was a great expeience as it broadened my viewpoint on what engineering could be.

                        <p> In 10th grade, I had an oppurtunity to go to a civil and software engineer company,
                            BART and Workday respectively. BART allowed me to find how the BART works, in 
                            terms of the train movement and the power. There are different types of "cars" (compartments, 
                            A2, B2, C1, etc and depending on the need, different compartments can be put together.
                            Each car has "shoes" which collect power of up to 1k Volts from a specialized rail through
                            collector shoes. Workday was also an amazing experience. Workday is a cloud management 
                            company that helps other companies manage everything from finances to human capital.
                            I met with several QAs (quality assurance) who's job was essentially to find faults and 
                            other mistakes within something. After finding an issue, they help fix and control it 
                            by connectng with differnt teams. Workday gave me an insight on how a software company 
                            works day to day. </p>

                        <p> In 10th grade, I took a tour of airspace which was hosted by the Patriot Jet 
                            Team. The field trip helped connect with the aerospace topics that I was learning 
                            in Principle of Engineering. I got a deeper insight into how the four laws of 
                            aerodynamics: drag, thrust, lift, and weight, are applied to a rocket. I was able
                            to get some inspiration to build my own paper rocket for the project which you can
                            find within the projects tab. Overall, the trip helped me gain more experience on 
                            how university students use their classes and school opportunities to help them get
                            a job in the engineering field.</p>

                        visited our school to talk to us about Artificial Intelligence and 
                        Machine Learning. This was my first introduction to the topic
                        so I was very curious to learn about it. I learned how neural netwroks
                        work and the effect of tweaking the nodes to perfect the program.
                        Learning from an actual software developer has helped me understand
                        the knowledge and the skills needed to become one. Not only developers
                        need basic programming fundamentals, they also need problem solving skills
                        and a creative mind to get a job.</p>

                        <p> In 10th grade, Maynard Holliday spoke about his life and where he worked.
                            His presentation was heavily focused on Chernobyl. In 1982, a nuclear reactor
                            blew up in Ukraine sending and spreading massive amounts of uranium atoms. The 
                            reactor due to massive surge of heat that was caused by the failure of the 
                            cooling systems. There was a direct impact on the environment, as gamma radiation
                            extreme heat, and rubble/debris made it very difficult to look for survivors.
                            The talk allowed me to realize how important is to make sure that all activities
                            have to be done carefully, with proper backup systems.</p>

                        <p> In 10th grade, Anthony Strawa, a former NASA scientist, gave a talk
                        on the dangers of air pollution. Currently, Strawa works with Sustainable
                        Silicon Valley to help tackle the issue. Air pollution is severly affected
                        by the burning of fossil fuels and gasoline. Thus, he warned us about the 
                        dangers that traffic jams cause, more than just time wasting for people 
                        stuck in it, but the damage it does to the environment. Cars release 
                        soot particles which have lots of carbons and other heavy metals which 
                        pollute the air and make it dangerous to breathe. </p>

                        <h4 style="color: #ed3c28">2021 November</h4>
                        
                        <p> From guest speaker Donald James, I have learned a lot of important information. 
                            The main thing that I learned was that having good manners is one of the most 
                            important fundamental toolsets you have. Good manners are not just helpful in 
                            everyday life, they can help you secure a job. Nowadays, most people have similar
                            educational and technological backgrounds so they are very even on that front. 
                            So in order to stand out, having kind and caring manners will certainly create a
                            difference between you and others. You have to not only say nice things and be 
                            kind, but you have to take action as well like holding doors for others, giving 
                            your full attention when someone is speaking to you, and more. Donald James covered
                            all of this in his book where he talks about how to get good manners as well as his
                            time at NASA.</p>
