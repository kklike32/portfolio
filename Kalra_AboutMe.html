                    <p class="col-md-9"> I am a freshman at Dublin 
                    High School. I am 14 years old and moved to the United 
                    States of America when I was 3. I was born in India.
                    I currently live in Dublin,  California with my younger 
                    sister and parents. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    I am highly motivated to secure a job in the 
                    computer science field. I believe I have the qualifications 
                    to be working in the field. I am a qualified leader, work 
                    well in teams, and love to learn new things. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    I am currently the president of Math Tips and 
                    Tricks club at my school. I organize the meetings every week 
                    to satisfy my club members. Every Friday, I teach the  
                    members different tips and tricks on different Math topics
                    such as multiplication or volume. I was gifted by God to
                    have a logical mind and I use that to my advantage. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    I am also an excellent team member. I have been 
                    in many team projects that help solve world problems.  
                    In 8th grade, I got together with my friends and decided to
                    solve the water shortage issue in Dublin, CA. My group 
                    decided to target the public areas that use water 
                    specifically. We first proposed  to add an area of turf in 
                    all the public parks so the city does not have to water it. 
                    We also proposed to use recycled water instead of 
                    fresh water to reuse water and limit the amount of it that 
                    our city uses. To decide on which idea was better, we 
                    surveyed people in our school and neighborhood to find which
                    solution do they like better. The results we got showed us 
                    that over 80% of the people like the recycle water solution
                    better. When we proposed this idea to the city, the council 
                    said that there are already laws in Dublin that require 
                    public areas to use recycled water. Even though the result 
                    did not turn out the way that we expected, we want to push 
                    this solutions into other cities that don't use recycled 
                    water. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    I am an ambitious learner because I am  not afraid to 
                    explore and learn new things. Being open-minded makes it 
                    very easy for me to grasp any topic. Curiosity  also drives 
                    me to go beyond than what I learn school. I do my research 
                    at home for stuff that I want to get better at in my own 
                    time.

                    <br>
                         One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I 
                    love to read fiction books of any genre. My favorite  genres
                    are sci-fi and fantasy. Another hobby I have is chess. I 
                    have loved logical puzzles since I was small and chess is a 
                    fantastic one. I have been playing chess since I was in 4th 
                    grade and brought my rating up to 1039. Now, I tutor 
                    elementary children on chess every week. My all-time 
                    favorite thing to do is to hang out with my friends. 
                    Currently, my favorite food is cheese pizza. My favorite 
                    soda is Sprite. One of my favorite quotes is <br>
                    "Life is like a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep
                    moving"<i>(Albert Einstein)</i>.<br>
                    Overall, I am happy with my beautiful life.
