                    <p class="col-md-9"> I am a junior at Dublin 
                    High School and I am 16 years old. My goal is to attend a
                    UC to complete my undergraduate with a computer science
                    degree and work as a software engineer. I believe I have the abilities and 
                    right support of teachers and parents to purse this career.

                    A profession in the computer science field requires many skill sets and personal charactersitics to succeed.
                    I have many of those qualities which I have demonstrated through my daily work and life activities. Successfull copmputer 
                    enggineer should be dedicated and persistent towards achieveing the desired results. While making website or any projects
                    or programs I keep working diligently till I get my desired results. I never give up in frustation. I keep trying with 
                    different angles and with patience whnever I am stuck on a problem to solve it. When I was working on Python image manip[ultion 
                    for one of my project I kept getting errors but I didn't give up. Finally after trials and errors and lots of research I succeeded.
                    I have displayed my logiocal thinking and creativity through playing chess and winning many games at school and state level too. 
                    This is another important another attribute which I have used in making better and unique programs.

                    Taking command or displaying leadership is another of my strength. I am currently the president of Fair Chance Club. Through
                    that club, my club members and I have helped out kids with special needs. Spending my time there has taught me humbleness 
                    and patience. I also volunteer at my place of worship where I help out in serving food. Taking time out to help others have made me 
                    realize the good things in my life and to keep focus on my goals.Working in teams is the norm today .This is specially true for computer science profession where team memebers are connected and 
                    work together, irrespective of located globally across different time zones. I too display my team spirit in dealing with different 
                    set of people while volunteering or even while leading my club or while working with classmates in team projects. I give importance to
                    soft skills in dealing with people in all aspects of my life.

                    Another one of my talents is being an excellent team member. 
                    I have been in many team projects that help solve world 
                    problems. In 8th grade, I got together with my friends and 
                    decided to solve the water shortage issue in Dublin, CA. My
                    group decided to target the public areas that use water 
                    specifically. We first proposed  to add an area of turf in 
                    all the public parks so the city does not have to water it. 
                    We also proposed to use recycled water instead of 
                    fresh water to reuse water and limit the amount of it that 
                    our city uses. To decide on which idea was better, we 
                    surveyed people in our school and neighborhood to find which
                    solution do they like better. The results we got showed us 
                    that over 80% of the people like the recycle water solution
                    better. When we proposed this idea to the city, the council 
                    said that there are already laws in Dublin that require 
                    public areas to use recycled water. Even though the result 
                    did not turn out the way that we expected, we want to push 
                    this solutions into other cities that don't use recycled 
                    water.

                    I am an ambitious learner because I am not afraid to 
                    explore and learn new things. Being open-minded makes it 
                    very easy for me to grasp any topic. Curiosity  also drives 
                    me to go over and beyond what I learn at school. I do my 
                    research at home for stuff that I want to get better at in 
                    my own time. Being curious and open minded has always 
                    helped me in solving challenges.

                         One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I 
                    love to read fiction books of any genre. My favorite  genres
                    are sci-fi and fantasy. Another hobby I have is chess. I 
                    have loved logical puzzles since I was small and chess is a 
                    fantastic one. I have been playing chess since I was in 4th 
                    grade and brought my rating up to 1039. Now, I tutor 
                    elementary children on chess every week. My all-time 
                    favorite thing to do is to hang out with my friends. 
                    Currently, my favorite food is cheese pizza. My favorite 
                    soda is Sprite. One of my favorite quotes is <br>
                    "Life is like a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep
                    moving"<i>(Albert Einstein)</i>.<br>
                    Overall, I am happy with my beautiful life.
