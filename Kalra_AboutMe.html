                    <p class="col-md-9">&nbsp  &nbsp I am a freshman at Dublin 
                    High School. I am 14 years old and moved to the United 
                    States of America when I was 3. I was born in India.
                    I currently live in Dublin,  California with my younger 
                    sister and parents. 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp  &nbsp I am highly motivated to secure a job in the 
                    computer science field. I believe I have the qualifications 
                    to be working in the field. I am a qualified leader, work 
                    well in teams, and love to learn new things. 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp  &nbsp I am currently the president of Math Tips and 
                    Tricks club at my school. I organize the meetings every week 
                    to satisfy my club members. Every Friday, I teach the  
                    members different tips and tricks on different Math topics
                    such as multiplication or volume. I was gifted by God to
                    have a logical mind and I use that to my advantage. 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp I am also an excellent team member. I have been 
                    in many team projects that help solvve world promblems. 
                    <br>
                    In 8th grade, I got together with my friends and decided to
                    solve the water shortage issue in Dublin, CA. 
                    &nbsp  &nbsp One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I 
                    love to read fiction books of any genre. My favorite  genres
                    are sci-fi and fantasy. Another hobby I have is chess. I 
                    have loved logical puzzles since I was small and chess is a 
                    fantastic one. I have been playing chess since I was in 4th 
                    grade and brought my rating up to 1039. Now, I tutor 
                    elementary children on chess every week. My all-time 
                    favorite thing to do is to hang out with my friends. 
                    Currently, my favorite food is cheese pizza. My favorite 
                    soda is Sprite. One of my favorite quotes is <br>
                    "Life is like a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep
                    moving"<i>(Albert Einstein)</i>.<br>
                    Overall, I am happy with my beautiful life.
