                    <p class="col-md-7">&nbsp  &nbsp I am a freshman at Dublin High School. I am 14 years old and
                    moved to United States of America when I was 3. I was born in India on August 11, 2004.
                    I currently live in Dublin,  California with my younger sister and parents. <br>
                     &nbsp  &nbsp One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I absolutelty love to read fiction books
                     of any genre. My personal favortie genres are sci-fi and fanstasy. Another hobby I have is 
                     chess. I have loved logical puzzles since I was born and chess is a fantastic one. I have 
                     been playing chess since I was in 4th grade and brought my rating up to 1039. Now, I tutor 
                     elementary children on chess every week. My all time favorite thing to do is to hang out with
                     my friends. Currently, my favorite food is cheese pizza. My favorite soda is Sprite. One of my 
                     favorite quote is <br>
                     "Life is like a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving<i>(Albert Einstein)</i>.
                     Overall, I am happy with my beautiful life.</p>
