                    <p class="col-md-9"> I am a freshman at Dublin 
                    High School. I am 14 years old and moved to the United 
                    States of America when I was 3. I was born in India
                    and currently live in Dublin, California with my younger 
                    sister and parents. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    I am highly motivated to secure a job in the 
                    computer science field. I believe I have the abilities and 
                    right support of teachers and parents to purse this career.
                    Some of the abilities which help me are my leadership 
                    skills, team player,and ambitious learner. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    I am currently the president of Math Tips and 
                    Tricks club at my school. Organizing the meetings every week 
                    to satisfy my club members is a challenging job because 
                    it requires lots of thinking and hard work to think of
                    something new every time. Every Friday, I teach the members 
                    different tips and tricks on different math topics such as 
                    multiplication or volume. God gifted me with a logical brain
                    and I use it to my advantage.  
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Another one of my talents is being an excellent team member. 
                    I have been in many team projects that help solve world 
                    problems. In 8th grade, I got together with my friends and 
                    decided to solve the water shortage issue in Dublin, CA. My
                    group decided to target the public areas that use water 
                    specifically. We first proposed  to add an area of turf in 
                    all the public parks so the city does not have to water it. 
                    We also proposed to use recycled water instead of 
                    fresh water to reuse water and limit the amount of it that 
                    our city uses. To decide on which idea was better, we 
                    surveyed people in our school and neighborhood to find which
                    solution do they like better. The results we got showed us 
                    that over 80% of the people like the recycle water solution
                    better. When we proposed this idea to the city, the council 
                    said that there are already laws in Dublin that require 
                    public areas to use recycled water. Even though the result 
                    did not turn out the way that we expected, we want to push 
                    this solutions into other cities that don't use recycled 
                    water.

                    I am an ambitious learner because I am not afraid to 
                    explore and learn new things. Being open-minded makes it 
                    very easy for me to grasp any topic. Curiosity  also drives 
                    me to go over and beyond what I learn at school. I do my 
                    research at home for stuff that I want to get better at in 
                    my own time. Being curious and open minded has always 
                    helped me in solving challenges.

                    <br>
                         One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I 
                    love to read fiction books of any genre. My favorite  genres
                    are sci-fi and fantasy. Another hobby I have is chess. I 
                    have loved logical puzzles since I was small and chess is a 
                    fantastic one. I have been playing chess since I was in 4th 
                    grade and brought my rating up to 1039. Now, I tutor 
                    elementary children on chess every week. My all-time 
                    favorite thing to do is to hang out with my friends. 
                    Currently, my favorite food is cheese pizza. My favorite 
                    soda is Sprite. One of my favorite quotes is <br>
                    "Life is like a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep
                    moving"<i>(Albert Einstein)</i>.<br>
                    Overall, I am happy with my beautiful life.
