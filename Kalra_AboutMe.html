                    <p class="col-md-9"> I am a first year attending UC Davis while pursuing a Computer Science and Engineering 
                        Degree. I love to learn new stuff, not afraid to get my hands wet when trying things, abd always keeping a
                        smile on my space.. I believe I have the abilities and right support from teachers, friends, parents to 
                        succeed in life.
                    
                    <br><br>
                        
                    A profession in the computer science field requires many skill sets and personal characteristics to succeed. 
                    I have many of those qualities which I have demonstrated through my daily work and life activities. 
                        Successful computer engineers should be dedicated and persistent towards achieving the desired results. 
                        While making websites or any projects or programs I keep working diligently till I get my desired results.
                        I never give up in frustration. I keep trying with different angles and with patience whenever I am stuck 
                        on a problem to solve it. When I was working on a Java contagion model, I often struggled with the code. 
                        So to think clearly, I take bike rides around my city which helps me find a solution. I have displayed my 
                        logical thinking and creativity through playing chess and winning many games at the school and state level
                        too. This is another important attribute that I have used in making better and unique programs.

                    
                    <br><br>    
                        
                    Taking command or displaying leadership is another of my strength. I was the president of the Fair Chance Club. 
                    Through that club, my club members and I have helped out kids with special needs. Spending my time there has taught me
                        humbleness and patience. I also volunteer at my place of worship where I help out in serving food. Taking time out 
                        to help others has made me realize the good things in my life and to keep the focus on my goals. Working in teams
                        is the norm today. This is especially true for the computer science profession where team members are connected and 
                        work together, irrespective of location globally across different time zones. I too display my team spirit in dealing
                        with different sets of people while volunteering or even while leading my club or while working with classmates on 
                        team projects. I give importance to soft skills in dealing with people in all aspects of my life.

                    Another one of my talents is being an excellent team member. 
                    I have been in many team projects that help solve world 
                    problems. In 8th grade, I got together with my friends and 
                    decided to solve the water shortage issue in Dublin, CA. My
                    group decided to target the public areas that use water 
                    specifically. We first proposed  to add an area of turf in 
                    all the public parks so the city does not have to water it. 
                    We also proposed to use recycled water instead of 
                    fresh water to reuse water and limit the amount of it that 
                    our city uses. To decide on which idea was better, we 
                    surveyed people in our school and neighborhood to find which
                    solution do they like better. The results we got showed us 
                    that over 80% of the people like the recycle water solution
                    better. When we proposed this idea to the city, the council 
                    said that there are already laws in Dublin that require 
                    public areas to use recycled water. Even though the result 
                    did not turn out the way that we expected, we want to push 
                    this solutions into other cities that don't use recycled 
                    water.

                    I am an ambitious learner because I am not afraid to explore and learn new things. 
                    Being open-minded makes it very easy for me to grasp any topic. Curiosity also drives 
                    me to go over and beyond what I learn at school. I do my research at home for stuff 
                    that I want to get better at in my own time. Being curious and open-minded has always 
                    helped me in solving challenges.

                    <br>
                         One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I 
                    love to read fiction books of any genre. My favorite  genres
                    are sci-fi and fantasy. Another hobby I have is chess. I 
                    have loved logical puzzles since I was small and chess is a 
                    fantastic one. I have been playing chess since I was in 4th 
                    grade and brought my rating up to 1039. Now, I tutor 
                    elementary children on chess every week. My all-time 
                    favorite thing to do is to hang out with my friends. 
                    Currently, my favorite food is cheese pizza. My favorite 
                    soda is Sprite. One of my favorite quotes is <br>
                    "Life is like a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep
                    moving"<i>(Albert Einstein)</i>.<br>
                    Overall, I am happy with my beautiful life.
