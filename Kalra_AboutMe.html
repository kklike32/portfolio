                    <p class="col-md-9">&nbsp  &nbsp I am a freshman at Dublin 
                    High School. I am 14 years old and moved to the United 
                    States of America when I was 3. I was born in India.
                    I currently live in Dublin,  California with my younger 
                    sister and parents. <br>
                    &nbsp  &nbsp One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I 
                    love to read fiction books of any genre. My favorite  genres
                    are sci-fi and fantasy. Another hobby I have is chess. I 
                    have loved logical puzzles since I was born and chess is a 
                    fantastic one. I have been playing chess since I was in 4th 
                    grade and brought my rating up to 1039. Now, I tutor 
                    elementary children on chess every week. My all-time 
                    favorite thing to do is to hang out with my friends. 
                    Currently, my favorite food is cheese pizza. My favorite 
                    soda is Sprite. One of my favorite quotes is <br>
                    "Life is like a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep
                    moving<i>(Albert Einstein)</i>.
                    Overall, I am happy with my beautiful life.
