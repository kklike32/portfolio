                                and I had to remix a game in

                                in Computer Science Principles. We decided to 
                                remix Oh My Spikes. Jacob and I first had to 
                                follow the

                                before we could modify anything. The tutorial
                                took us a long time to finish so we didn't have 
                                enough time to add extra features. However, we still managed to
                                add an instruction screen, background image, 
                                change the amount of spikes, and its size. I also
                                worked on coding up a big center spike but I ran 
                                out of time. One of our biggest challenges that 
                                we had to overcome was to find time to code up 
                                our wonderful ideas. We could only code very 
                                little because learning the language took up a long time. You can find our source code

                                <p> In 10th grade at DHS, my team and I had to create paper rockets and 
                                    used a launcher to test out our rockets. Our goal was to design
                                    a rocket using only paper and tape and then test it. First I 
                                    researched the imapct of different wing shapes and sizes on the
                                    distance the airplane travels. Overall, I found that curved and
                                    small (staying close to the body) increased the distance in which
                                    the airplane would travel. After that, I built my plane using the
                                    cardstock paper and duct tape. My first plane did not go as far 
                                    as I expected. For my second plane, I made the cone sturdier and
                                    taller so the wind would easily slip and the rocket would pierce 
                                    the air like an arrow enabling it to go further. You can find the

                                <p> In 9th grade at DHS, my partner Parth Joshi
                                and I had to use Python to create a function that 
                                takes a picture and lets the user transform it. 
                                We focused our topic on promoting my club, MTT.
                                Using the PIL and numpy libraries, we converted
                                pictures of famoues people into pictures that 
                                supports MTT. The user can decide what features 
                                they want the final picture to have. Some 
                                features that the user can change are logo
                                placement, tinting color and shade, border 
                                color, and more. My main contribution to the 
                                project was to create the user interface and 
                                add all the specialized features such as a border
                                to the image. I specifically used the matplotlib 
                                library to manipulate the image pixel by pixel.

                                <p> During my sophomore year of high school, 
                                    I worked with a team to construct a vehicle
                                    that runs for solar and/or hydrogen cells.
                                    The vehicle had to be 12 inches by 5 inches
                                    and had to consisted of VEX parts.  My main
                                    contribution was to construct the top half
                                    of the vehicle which supports the board and 
                                    fuel cells which power the motor to make our
                                    car move. I used standoffs to levitate a 
                                    platform that can house such different types
                                    of objects required to run the machine. Our 
                                    vehicle came to have a 23.46% efficiency 
                                    considering the two types of energy sources

            <h5>During my time in the engineering program, I have met a number 
                of industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest 
                speakers which has broadened my perspective on Engineering.  The 
                field trips helped my identify possible workplaces/colleges that I
                can attend in the future. The workplaces showed me the many careers
                that are available within Engineering, including QA analyst, 
                environmental engineer, marine engineer, e.t.c. Guest speakers 
                helped me realize what  people do on a daily basis when 
                working in the field.</h5>

                        <p> In 10th grade, I went on a campus tour to both San Jose State and 
                        Santa Clara University. Since I am a high schooler, I was 
                        interested in learning about university life and how to get accepted.
                        The trip provided me with more than just the answers; the tour showed 
                        me how to apply for various majors like Computer Science major
                        which I can apply for. Santa Clara university also showed me how I can 
                        learn biotech, one of the fastest growing industries, while still
                        taking regular computer science classes. Overall, the trip helped me 
                        gain more experience on how university students use their classes
                        and school oppurtunities to help them get a job in the engineering field.</p>

                        visited our school to talk to us about Artificial Intelligence and 
                        Machine Learning. This was my first introduction to the topic
                        so I was very curious to learn about it. I learned how neural netwroks
                        work and the effect of tweaking the nodes to perfect the program.
                        Learning from an actual software developer has helped me understand
                        the knowledge and the skills needed to become one. Not only developers
                        need basic programming fundamentals, they also need problem solving skills
                        and a creative mind to get a job.</p>
