                                in Computer Science Principles. We decided to 
                                remix Oh My Spikes. Jacob and I first had to 
                                follow the

                                before we could modify anything. The tutorial
                                took us a long time to finish so we didn't have 
                                enough time to add extra features. However, we still managed to
                                add an instruction screen, background image, 
                                change the amount of spikes, and its size. I also
                                worked on coding up a big center spike but I ran 
                                out of time. One of our biggest challenges that 
                                we had to overcome was to find time to code up 
                                our wonderful ideas. We could only code very 
                                little because learning the language took up a long time. You can find our source code

                                <p> In 10th grade at DHS, my team and I had to create paper rockets and 
                                    used a launcher to test out our rockets. Our goal was to design
                                    a rocket using only paper and tape and then test it. First I 
                                    researched the imapct of different wing shapes and sizes on the
                                    distance the airplane travels. Overall, I found that curved and
                                    small (staying close to the body) increased the distance in which
                                    the airplane would travel. After that, I built my plane using the
                                    cardstock paper and duct tape. My first plane did not go as far 
                                    as I expected. For my second plane, I made the cone sturdier and
                                    taller so the wind would easily slip and the rocket would pierce 
                                    the air like an arrow enabling it to go further. You can find the

                                <p> In 9th grade at DHS, my partner Parth Joshi
                                and I had to use Python to create a function that 
                                takes a picture and lets the user transform it. 
                                We focused our topic on promoting my club, MTT.
                                Using the PIL and numpy libraries, we converted
                                pictures of famoues people into pictures that 
                                supports MTT. The user can decide what features 
                                they want the final picture to have. Some 
                                features that the user can change are logo
                                placement, tinting color and shade, border 
                                color, and more. My main contribution to the 
                                project was to create the user interface and 
                                add all the specialized features such as a border
                                to the image. I specifically used the matplotlib 
                                library to manipulate the image pixel by pixel.

                                <p> During my sophomore year of high school, 
                                    I worked with a team to construct a vehicle
                                    that runs for solar and/or hydrogen cells.
                                    The vehicle had to be 12 inches by 5 inches
                                    and had to consisted of VEX parts.  My main
                                    contribution was to construct the top half
                                    of the vehicle which supports the board and 
                                    fuel cells which power the motor to make our
                                    car move. I used standoffs to levitate a 
                                    platform that can house such different types
                                    of objects required to run the machine. Our

                        <p> In 9th grade at DHS, my partner Parth Joshi
                        and I had to use Python to create a function that 
                        takes a picture and lets the user transform it. 
                        We focused our topic on promoting my club, MTT.
                        Using the PIL and numpy libraries, we converted
                        pictures of famoues people into pictures that 
                        supports MTT. The user can decide what features 
                        they want the final picture to have. Some 
                        features that the user can change are logo
                        placement, tinting color and shade, border 
                        color, and more. My main contribution to the 
                        project was to create the user interface and 
                        add all the specialized features such as a border
                        to the image. I specifically used the matplotlib 
                        library to manipulate the image pixel by pixel.

                        in Computer Science Principles. We decided to 
                        remix Oh My Spikes. Jacob and I first had to 
                        follow the 
                        <a href="http://www.imagnity.com/android/oh-my-spikes-create-a-game-from-scratch-using-app-inventor/" target="_blank">

                        before we could modify anything. The tutorial
                        took us a long time to finish so we didn't have 
                        enough time to add extra features. However, we still managed to
                        add an instruction screen, background image, 
                        change the amount of spikes, and its size. I also
                        worked on coding up a big center spike but I ran 
                        out of time. One of our biggest challenges that 
                        we had to overcome was to find time to code up 
                        our wonderful ideas. We could only code very 
                        little because learning the language took up a long time. You can find our source code

                        <p> During my sophomore year of high school, 
                            I worked with a team to construct a vehicle
                            that runs for solar and/or hydrogen cells.
                            The vehicle had to be 12 inches by 5 inches
                            and had to consisted of VEX parts.  My main
                            contribution was to construct the top half
                            of the vehicle which supports the board and 
                            fuel cells which power the motor to make our
                            car move. I used standoffs to levitate a 
                            platform that can house such different types
                            of objects required to run the machine. Our 
                            vehicle came to have a 23.46% efficiency 
                            considering the two types of energy sources

                        <p> In 10th grade at DHS, my team and I had to create paper rockets and 
                            used a launcher to test out our rockets. Our goal was to design
                            a rocket using only paper and tape and then test it. First I 
                            researched the imapct of different wing shapes and sizes on the
                            distance the airplane travels. Overall, I found that curved and
                            small (staying close to the body) increased the distance in which
                            the airplane would travel. After that, I built my plane using the
                            cardstock paper and duct tape. My first plane did not go as far 
                            as I expected. For my second plane, I made the cone sturdier and
                            taller so the wind would easily slip and the rocket would pierce 
                            the air like an arrow enabling it to go further. You can find the

                        <p> During summer break between 10th and 11th grades, I had to 
                            create a Java project in a GUI system called Greenfooot and 
                            I decided to do a scale down version of a virus. I implemnted
                            three main classes: a regular person, an infected person, and 
                            an immune person. A subclass of the regular person that I 
                            created was te Child class, which takes after all attributes
                            of the Person Class. All the people move around randomly and thus 
                            randomly hit an infected person. There are 5 trials that the users
                            can see, and with each trial, the percentage of people social
                            distancing (for my version it means staying in one place) increases.
                            For the run, people also die off if the current number of infected 
                            people reaches a certain limit in order to show the real-life 
                            scenarious of ICUs filling up. At the end of the 5 trials, 5 different 
                            colored graphs appear on the screen along with statistics for each trial.
                            Overall, this project was rather fun to accomplish because it represented 
                            a real life situation that was going on at that time.

                        <p> As a project for CSA, I had to use a data source online and create a project
                            around it. Since I enjoy watching basketball, I choose to create a program
                            which will give me all the statistics pertaining to NBA Drafts and 
                            the players that were picked. First, I had to find a data source
                            that I could properly link to as there were so many in the wrong

                            them, the minutes they played, the total amount of points they scored
                            and more. My next step was to create a constructor method which 
                            would store all the players and their information in a seperate 
                            array list that I could parse through to get information. I created 
                            seperate methods that provided the user with certain data if they 
                            gave certain information. For example, if they typed in an NBA team,
                            the program would return all the players that were drafted by that 
                            specific NBA team. Overall, it was a challenging and fun process as
                            I got to learn how to use online data sources in my programs.

                        <p> My group and I had to an education Java game, and we decided to 
                            use Greenfoot, a GUI system. We decided to create a particle 
                            simulator in which the users can learn about the reactions
                            of various molecules and elements with one another. For this 
                            project, my group had to implement the initial gravity and velocity 
                            for the particles as well as the reactions. I was in charge of 
                            creating the particles, like carbon dioxide, water vapor, hydrogen,
                            oxygen, etc, and their reactions. Implementing the reactions was 
                            tough because there were several important factors like if the 
                            two reactants had enough initialize energy to start the reaction.
                            Our project started with 100 different particles, with many types,
                            but the user can spawn in their own particles. The system prints
                            to the terminal whenever a reaction happens. The screen also shows 
                            the overall temperature and pressure of the "container".

                        <p> With this project, I understood and learned about the basics of the D flip-flop. 
                            First, I analyzed and designed a binary counter circuit through the analysis of 
                            the circuit’s period, frequency, and output pattern. Then, I used the Multisim 
                            circuit design software to design the circuit and simulate it online. I played 
                            around with the inputs to find out that binary can be used to construct counters 
                            to turn the lights off or on. The next step was to actually build the circuit on a
                            breadboard. The hardest part was to keep track of different wires and actually get
                            it to work. Through careful analysis of my online circuit, I was able to successfully 
                            build the circuit and take pictures of it.

                        <p> 
                            With the project, I looked at the outputs of different parts of a random number
                            generator circuit and put them together in the Multisim circuit design software. 
                            The random number generator selects a random number between 1 and 6 and showcases 
                            to how they will look in the dice. Timers within the circuit can help generate random 
                            numbers through a circuit signal with a switch and high frequency. One challenge that 
                            I faced was figuring out the switch to essentially stop the circuit and actually produce
                            one number that does not change. The switch placement was in between the clock and the 
                            logical part of the circuit.
